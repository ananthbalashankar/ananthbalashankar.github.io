	<h2>Welcome</h2>
	<p>I'm a 3rd year Ph.D student in Computer Science advised by <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~lakshmi/Lakshmi/Home.html"> Prof. Lakshminarayanan Subramanian </a> at NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. 
	I'm also fortunate to be co-advised by <a href="http://alexbeutel.com/">Dr. Alex Beutel</a>, Research Scientist at Google, and sponsored as a Student Research Scholar as part of the Google Student Research Advisorship Program.
	I'm currently interested in Interpretable Machine Learning and the challenges involved in applying machine perception for the domains of policy, privacy, economics and healthcare. </p>

	<p>Prior to this, I worked as a Software Engineer at Google for almost 3 years where I worked on the app recommendations team at Google Play Store and the Play Developer Console in Mountain View and London respectively. In 2014, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur with a B.Tech/M.Tech degree in Computer Science advised by Prof. Niloy Ganguly.</p>
	
	<p> New: Recieved the NYU Harold Grad Memorial Prize for outstanding performance and promise as a graduate student. </p>
