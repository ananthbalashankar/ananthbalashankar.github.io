	<p>I'm a final year Ph.D candidate in Computer Science advised by <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~lakshmi/Lakshmi/Home.html"> Prof. Lakshminarayanan Subramanian </a> at NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences 
	and <a href="http://alexbeutel.com/">Dr. Alex Beutel</a>, Senior Staff Research Scientist at Google.
	I work on enhancing robustness of machine learning models by incorporating domain-specific structure for applications in the domains
	of natural language, socio-economics, public health, and privacy. I am also a Student Researcher at Google AI (2019-22), where I work on counterfactual text robustness.
	Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Google for 3 years, where I worked on recommendations at Google Play Store and the Play Developer Console in Mountain View and London. 
	I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur with B.Tech/M.Tech in Computer Science advised by <a href="http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~niloy/">Prof. Niloy Ganguly</a>.</p>

	<h2>Research Interests</h2>
	I am interested in building domain faithful ML models through methodologies including constrained optimization, data augmentation and causal feature selection.
	Broadly, my work has had demonstrable <i>business and research impact across five real world application domains</i>:
	<ol>
		<li><b>Famine Forecasting</b><br>
		Forecasting famine is critical for the mobilization of aid to millions of people, but hard to solve due to data scarcity in fragile countries. 
		By building a news-based causal-aware forecasting framework that extracts causal features from 11.2 million news articles across 2 decades in 15 fragile countries, we have improved forecasting accuracy by 32% compared to state-of-the-art predictive models. 
		This <a href="#famine2">paper</a> is accepted at IC2S2 '21, the premiere computational social science conference, and <a href="#famine">under review</a> at a Science sub-journal. 
		The tool will be used by the World Bank Data Science group for aid allocation on food security. 
		Based on this research, a few co-authors have founded a socio-economic inference start-up <a href="http://vel.ai/">Velai, Inc</a>.</li><br>
		<li><b>Toxic Comments Detection</b><br>
		Automated detection of online toxic comments improves the quality of interaction in social media.
		However, the variations in context of comments make it hard to protect specific demographic groups from disparate impact. 
		By explicitly modeling such nuances through counterfactual data augmentation, we improved the accuracy of detecting toxicity by 6%
		Through this <a href="#robust1">publication</a> at EMNLP '21, a premiere NLP conference, I have fostered deep engagements with Google's Responsible ML team.
		I have also <a href="#play">deployed</a> ML models that optimize business objectives like diversity at Google Play.</li><br>
		<li><b>Causal Question Answering</b><br>
		Causality based question answering lies at the core of customer support tools like chatbots. 
		Prior ML models fail to capture the directed nature of causality, for example rain causes traffic delay, and not vice versa. 
		By learning asymmetric causal embeddings faithful to causal graphs, we improved accuracy on Yahoo! Answers by 21% in this <a href="#faithful">paper</a> at ACL '21, a premiere NLP conference.</li><br>
		<li><b>Health Recommendations</b><br>
		Trustworthy ML models in health recommendations need to be faithful to medical concepts over unseen patient data, while traditional ML models focus only on optimizing accuracy over the observed but limited test data.
		By incorporating trust through doctor specified mapping rules between diagnoses and medications through data augmentation, we have improved accuracy of state-of-the-art end-to-end neural models by 12% in this <a href="#concordance">publication</a> at WSDM '21, the premiere data mining conference.</li><br>
		<li><b>Privacy Enforcement</b><br>
		Corporate privacy compliance policies are legally prescriptive, but not directly enforceable in computer systems. 
		By using the theory of contextual integrity through post-processing mappings, we have improved the accuracy of BERT-based deep learning models by 6% to extract privacy parameters for SQL-based enforcement in this <a href="#privacy1">paper</a> at WWW' 19, the premiere web research conference.</li>
	</ol>
